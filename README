NAME
    AxKit::XSP::Minisession - Yet Another Session Handling Library

SYNOPSIS
    In your config file:

        PerlSetVar MinisessionDir /tmp/sessions
        PerlSetVar MinisessionLockDir /tmp/sessionlock
        AxAddXSPTaglib +AxKit::XSP::Minisession

    In your XSP code:

        <xsp:page
            xmlns:session="http://squash.oucs.ox.ac.uk/XSP/Minisession"
        >

        <session:set-value username="simon"/>
        <session:get-value>username</s:get-value>

    In your Perl code:

        die "Already logged in" if
            AxKit::XSP::Minisession::Backend::get_value($r, "username");
        AxKit::XSP::Minisession::Backend::set_value($r, "username", $username);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very simple session library which sets state via a cookie and
    uses "Apache::Session::File" to store sessions in files on the file
    system. If you need anything more complex than that, this module isn't
    for you.

    The guts of the module are the two functions "get_value" and "set_value"
    in the "::Backend" module. The first parameter to these should be an
    "Apache::Request" object, and the second a hash key.

    These functions are wrapped by the "set-value" and "get-value" tags from
    XSP.

    And that's it. I said it was very simple.

TAG REFERENCE
  set-value
    Assigns the given name/value pair to the currenct session.

  get-value
    Returns the currennt session value for the itemd requested.
